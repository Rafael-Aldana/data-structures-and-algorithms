# Challenge Title
Write a function called left join
Arguments: two hash maps
The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic

## Approach & Efficiency

Jonathan and I researched the lef join method. Then I created the whiteboard and started with the whiteboarding process. At the same time Jonathan was thinking throiugh the algorithm. At the end we both got together and coded out the problem.
