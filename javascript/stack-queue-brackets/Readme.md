# stack-queue-brackets

Problem Domain

Write a function called validate brackets
Arguments: string

representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced
There are 3 types of brackets:

Round Brackets : ()
Square Brackets : []
Curly Brackets : {}

## Whiteboard Process

[Whiteboard](javascript/assets/stack-queue-brackets.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
John and I did partner coding he got the white board together meanwhile I was researching ways to get the code finished. In the end we ended up using a stack. We popped out parentheses that matched each other and returned false for the ones that didnt match.
