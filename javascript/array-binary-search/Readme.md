# Binary Search of Sorted Array

Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency

First we found a jacascript method that would do the same thing as BinarySearch function.
Then we strated talking through the process of what the actual code would look like and what it would.
After that we started writing psuedo code that mocked the functionality of our algorithm.
Finally we started writing code.
